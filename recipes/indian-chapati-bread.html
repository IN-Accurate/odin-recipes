                        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and salt</li>
                        <li>Use a wooden spoon to stir in the olive oil and enough water to make a soft dough that is elastic but not sticky</li>
                        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is smooth</li>
                        <li>Divide into 10 parts, or less if you want bigger breads</li>
                        <li>Roll each piece into a ball,let rest for a few minutes</li>
                        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat until hot, and grease lightly</li>
                        <li>n a lightly floured surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the balls of dough until very thin like a tortilla</li>
                        <li>When the pan starts smoking, put a chapati on it</li>
                        <li>Cook until the underside has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook on the other side</li>
                        <li>Continue with remaining dough</li>
            </ol>
